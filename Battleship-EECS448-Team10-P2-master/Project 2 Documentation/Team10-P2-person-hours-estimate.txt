Initial Estimate of Project 1:

(72 hours) by our 4 team members (est. 15 hours per person) as well as 3 meetings that last 1 hr throughout the project (12 hours total)
(60 + 12 = 72) needed to accomplish a significant amount of goals:

Creating repository and getting git set up on all devices, figuring out a method of communication for our group, meeting
to discuss where we are at on the project, fixing current bugs brought over by the last team, understanding the 2 classes we 
have for this project (board, executive), creating documentation both on the header files and making the html file, filling out
personal hours documentation, and doing the design paradigm essay. We have to create the three AI systems, and add the extra feature
in which we plan to make extra special attacks that can be used once per game. Extra hours also included for anticipated confusion on
project as well as checking and preparing our project for submission. 

We anticipate doing all of this will take roughly 18 hours a person to be safe as a lot of code and planning has to be done for
this project.


Final Hours of Project 1 ():

We found that the project took a lot less time than we thought as we were relatively efficient with our coding and planning.
In the future, we hope to be faster with our planning and coding as well as improve our communication skills and make sure the
team is working an even amount of hours as there was quite an unbalance in the hours our team contributed. Unfortunately, these
are the same problems our team ran into during project 1.
